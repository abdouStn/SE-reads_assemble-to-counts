note: pipeline currently in development

# SE-reads_assemble-to-counts
Uses short single end reads from multiple individuals to generate a reference transcriptome. Maps reads to reference transcriptome.

This repo uses pieces of the IBIS-Trinity-Pipeline: https://github.com/enormandeau/trinity_pipeline_ibis
and the Simple Fools Guide from the Palumbi lab: http://sfg.stanford.edu/guide.html

Currently being set up for use on Katak at IBIS, but can be easily adapted for your own computer cluster.
Run all jobs from the main directory SE-reads_assemble-to-counts/

Put raw fastq.gz single-end data into the 02_raw_data folder
